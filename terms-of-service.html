      <p>Our games may include ads or use third-party services. We do not control the content of ads and are not responsible for any third-party services used within our games. Please refer to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

      <h3>5. Updates and Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update our games or these terms at any time. Continued use of our games after an update implies acceptance of the new terms.</p>

      <h3>6. Termination</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to our games for any violation of these terms, suspected abuse, or illegal activity.</p>

      <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
